Assignment Name: Assignment 2 - Small Steps

Author: <John Doe> 

Description: < What is the purpose of this file? What does it do? > The purpose of this file is to show the steps it takes to create a program that will add, subtract, multiply, and divide any two real numbers that the user chooses.

Additional Notes: < what additional notes would someone need to know if they ran your program? > Additional notes would be that they can only use real numbers and that the program does four operations separately from one another rather than together. i.e. (4+2)*3 

Date: <submission date> (could be expanded upon by including versions and dates when code changed)

# Step 1: write code to get one value from the user
#    Page 16 has an example of this  

# Step 2: write code to get a second value from the user

# Step 3: display output to user
#   Use one print statement per math operator (+, -, /, *)
