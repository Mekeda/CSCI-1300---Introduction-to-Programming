### Course Description:
This class teaches techniques for writing computer programs in higher level programming languages to solve problems of interest in a range of application domains. 
This class is intended for students with little to no experience in computing or programming.

### Course Outcomes:
  * Cover the basics of computer programming using primarily two languages: Python and C++. The focus will be on understanding the basic components of computer languages. 
  At termâ€™s end: the students should comprehend variables, data types, control structures, file operations, functions, objects, and pointers.
  * In addition, the students are exposed to algorithm development, data structures and classes on an elementary level.
  * We also expose the students to how to decompose a problem into a series of steps that can then be translated into a syntactically correct computer program. 
  We discuss third-party libraries, such as APIs, and how to include them in our programs.
